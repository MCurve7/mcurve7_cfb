Looking at the Yards to Success vs Yards Gained we had SRs by down of 1st: 0.48, 2nd: 0.48, and 3rd: 0.64 with no 4th down attempts.
Besides being almost at 0.50 SR on 1st and 2nd downs and over on 3rd,
on 2nd down all successful plays resulted in a TD or 1st down.
There were two other games where the number of successful plays were almost the same as the number of TD/1st downs. 
The first was Arkansas with 8 successful plays, 7 TD/1st down plays, but 14 unsuccessful plays which also occurred on 2nd down 
and the second was vs Tennessee with 4 successful, 4 TD/1st down plays, but 16 unsuccessful plays which again occurred on 2nd down.
The other thing that I noticed from this graph is that most of the successful plays came from 5 or more than yards out
which is the maximum distance if you were successful on standard 1st down distance.

A quick mention about penalties before getting back to work.
While we officially had only 6 penalties we actually had 8.
One was offset by a Kentucky penalty and one was declined since we had two penalties on the same play.
