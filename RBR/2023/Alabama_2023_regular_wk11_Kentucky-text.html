Looking at the Yards to Success vs Yards Gained we had SRs by down of 1st: 0.48, 2nd: 0.48, and 3rd: 0.64 with no 4th down attempts.
Besides being almost at 0.50 SR on 1st and 2nd downs and over on 3rd,
on 2nd down all successful plays resulted in a TD or 1st down.
There were two other games where the number of successful plays were almost the same as the number of TD/1st downs. 
The first was Arkansas with 8 successful plays, 7 TD/1st down plays, but 14 unsuccessful plays which also occurred on 2nd down 
and the second was vs Tennessee with 4 successful, 4 TD/1st down plays, but 16 unsuccessful plays which again occurred on 2nd down.
The other thing that I noticed from this graph is that most of the successful plays came from 5 or more than yards out
which is the maximum distance if you were successful on standard 1st down distance.

A quick mention about penalties before getting back to work.
While we officially had only 6 penalties we actually had 8.
One was offset by a Kentucky penalty and one was declined since we had two penalties on the same play.

Oh and I had a bit of "bug" in my code while calculating the <i>z</i>-scores.
I kept thinking something looked a bit off 
and finally my brain kicked in and realized that the numbers were too big,
but the teams were still ordered correctly.
So within the SEC we are now the fourth least penalized team and Tennessee is still the most penalized team.
In comparison to the FBS we are tied as 55th most penalized team with two other teams.
We have a <i>z</i>-score of 0.06.
For comparison Colorado is the most penalized team with a <i>z</i>-score of 1.28
and Army is the least penalized team with a <i>z</i>-score of -1.09.
