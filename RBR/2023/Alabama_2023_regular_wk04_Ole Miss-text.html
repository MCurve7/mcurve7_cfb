<p>
If you would like to see and play with the interactive version of these graphs you can find them at
https://github.com/MCurve7/mcurve7_cfb/tree/main/RBR/2023
You just need to download the Alabama_(year)_regular_wk??_(opponent).html file and open it in a web browser.

I don't have enough time to try to analyze this weeks game (work and trying to fix the play data),

Note that the penalty data is off in terms of the number of penalties committed by us.
Not sure what happened.
Also ESPN is missing Ole Miss's week 3 data.

Roll Tide!
