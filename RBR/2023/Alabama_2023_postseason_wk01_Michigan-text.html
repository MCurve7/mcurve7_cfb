Man is this thing late. It took so long that Saban had time to retire before I could finish working on it.

This is as far as I got in doing my analysis and writing this up.
It's incomplete and I didn't make notes.
So to complete it I would have to rewatch the game and I'd rather not.
I'm sure there are typos and incomplete thoughts,
but maybe something is better than nothing.
Mainly I am doing this to check that the package updates haven't broken my code.

In terms of SR both teams had very similar numbers: Alabama 0.364 vs Michigan 0.356.
The SR by drive average was somewhat in our favor: Alabama 0.304 vs Michigan 0.267.
Given the interpretation I've been going with says both teams fairly were inconsistent.
So that doesn't seem to explain why Michigan won.
Let's drill down a bit and look at each drive's SR and play a game.
Whose SR by drive is whose in the table below?

Team A is of course... Alabama? 
I'm a bit surprised by this given what my brain thinks it saw. 
I would have though Michigan would have had the better SR by drive though they are fairly close.
But this does correspond to the mean SR_drive values we saw above: Alabama 0.304 vs Michigan 0.267.
One of the things that is not captured in this table is our turnover on drive 10 which had a SR of 0.5.
So far we are looking just a bit better than Michigan since we can view their muffed punt as a turnover which evens that up.

What else can we look at?
Well since I did decide to start calculating XR I guess we might as well go ahead and look at that.
They had a mean XR of 0.132 (stdev = 0.060) and against us that went up to 0.153 which is 0.351 standard deviations above their mean.
That doesn't seem to be that much of jump especially given that they had some really low XRs strewn about their schedule: 
0.091 Bowling Green, 0.093 Penn State, 0.030 Maryland, and 0.016 Iowa.
They did have 5 games with a higher XR than vs us:
0.171 Purdue, 0.177 East Carolina, 0.193 Minnesota, 0.194 Michigan State, and 0.217 UNLV.
And it was almost the exact same as they had against Ohio St: 0.150.
</p>

<p>
Our season average XR was 0.147 (stdev = 0.030) and we had an XR of 0.091.
That is -1.873 standard deviations below our mean!
And that is what I (amongst many others) would say was what lost us this game,
we couldn't manufacture the boom plays and were stuck with lots of busts.
