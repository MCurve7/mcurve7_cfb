Unfortunately work has interfered with fun, so this will be pretty short in addition to being late.
I think balloons and others have covered what happened in the game pretty well (from my limited reading so far this week).
Penalties were the biggest issue that popped out of my graphs; there were many ugly pink stars twinkling merrily away.
(Don't recall if that the correct use of a semicolon and if not just go ahead and throw another flag.)
</p>

<p>
There has been some discussion of whether we were over penalized or not (we were IMHO).
But of the 17 penalties 8 of them were False starts, Offsides, or Delay of games, and so were not really jusgement calls. 
That's basically 47% of all our penalties.

Since the penalty data is not reliable in my data source I used 
<a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/alabama/2022/gamelog/">Sports Reference</a>
to get the following data since they seem to be pretty good about being accurate from the spot checks I've made (not this season).
The following table is not in order of games played because it's late and I wasn't paying attention:

Well that seems interesting, we are 1 standard devation above the SEC mean and Tennessee is the next closest at about a half standard deviation.
Mizzou is close at 0.48 and then from there is drops to 0.2 and of course continues to go down.
I don't have a problem with being the most penalized team in the SEC in the sense that someone has to be,
but that jump from 0.54 to 1.02 seems suspicious.

<p>
But hey, at least they are protecting players and especially QBs from things like getting hit in the head!
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I'll have more time to look at graphs next week and if I have time to relook at this game I will.

Roll Tide!
