Well that was satisfying.
Looking at the SR by Drive there are a lot of pretty Crimson touchdown bars (9) dominating the four gray "neither" bars and one sad hot pink turnover bar.
Our SR was 0.492.
This was higher than most of our games last season except (as seen in the second table below): Middle Tennessee, LSU, Kentucky, and Chattanooga.
But our XP of 0.200 was better than any game last season except Chattanooga.
One of the things I'm going to track this season is each games SR vs that games SR by Drive mean.
Last season it seemed to be an indication of consistency.
In this game our SR = 0.492 and μ(SR by drive) = 0.486
and I think we were fairly consistent over the whole game.

WKU's SR was 0.149 and their μ(SR by drive) = 0.097
and I would say their drives were inconsistent.
Hopefully this will be true 
and give another statistic to measure how well a team played.
Those two hot pink turnover bars in their graph below are nice to see
as are those tiny SR bars.
Their best SR by Drive was two drives of 0.333
and they had nine drives with a SR = 0!
</p>

<div id="Western Kentucky_2024_regular_wk01_Alabama-01-success_drive_bar-copy" ></div><br />

<p>
The next part of the SR by Drive that jumps out at me and has been mentioned by many people is the drive lengths 
and in particular on the TD drives as seen in the table below:
</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<th>Drive #</th>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>7</td>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>10</td>
	<td>11</td>
	<td>13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th># of plays</th>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>9</td>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />

<p>
Other than the two drives off of interceptions we didn't have short fields so those numbers would imply you should have a fairly high XR.
</p>

<p>
When I added the <i>Success by down</i> table this is what I expected it to look like when a team was playing well.
As you go from 1st down to 2nd down and then from 2nd down to 3rd the play count should decrease
and the mean/median distance would also decrease.
In the <i>Yards to Success vs Yards gained</i> graph on 1st down you of course expect the points to be bunched up around 10 yards
and would like to see a majority of them at least above the green success line and hopefully above the dot-dashed 1st/TD line.
As we move to the 2nd down and then 3rd down facets,
we would like to see the points migrate to the left and also decrease in number.
</p>

<p>
Looking at 1st down, 
of the 16 unsuccessful plays 13 were runs
and the 3 passes were incompletes.
Of the 13 successful plays 8 were runs (4 explosives)
and 5 were passes (1 explosive).
On 2nd down there were 12 unsuccessful plays which consisted of 11 runs and 1 incompletion.
There were 7 successful runs (1 explosive) and 3 successful passes (2 explosives).
Then on 3rd down we had 5 unsuccessful plays: 
3 runs (1 fumble recovery) and 2 incompletes.
There were 8 successful plays: 
4 runs (2 explosives) and 4 passes (3 explosives).
</p>

<p>
A quick hand calculation gives 27 unsuccessful runs and 6 unsuccessful passes.
So of our 33 unsuccessful plays 81.8% were runs 
and 18.2% were passes.
We also had 19 successful runs with 13 successful passes.
A little Excel gives a total of 32 successful plays where 62.5% were runs 
and 37.5% passes.
I feel like I have lost the thread of where I was going with this.
While 72.3% of all our plays were runs leaving 27.7% passes
it feels like 81.8% of unsuccessful plays being runs is a potential problem.
Maybe after next weeks game I can order my thought on this some more.

<p>
On the penalty front,
I was having flash backs to last season in the 1st quarter.
Of our 7 penalties,
we committed 5 of them in the first quarter with the last at around 3:15.
Then we had another penalty around 13:32 of the 2nd quarter
and proceeded to not have another until around 13:20 of the 3rd.
As long as we play more like quarters 2-4 in terms of penalties I think we will be fine.
</p>

<p>
I will mention that the roughing the passer penalty on WKU's # 3 was just bad.
I hate all poorly called (or failed to be called) penalties whether on us or our opponents.
The game is hard enough without refs calling penalties that didn't happen.

It's great to have football back 
and Bama football back in particular.
