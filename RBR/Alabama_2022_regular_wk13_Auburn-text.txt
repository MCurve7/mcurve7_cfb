Due to processing errors and work this is both late and short.

In what is most likely to be the penultimate game of the 2022 season, 
the penalty penalty problems that seemed to be corrected showed back up.
There were 11 enforced penalties and one that was declined since it happened on the same as a DPI call.
(Unfortunately the play by play data doesn't record the declined penalties as reliably as I had hoped.)
Auburn decided to try to match us but were only able to commit 9 enforced penalties and 1 declined penalty.
This gives us 98 penalties for the regular season with a <i>z</i>-score of 1.84 
which edged out Tennessee (sum = 96, <i>z</i> = 1.64) for the most in the season.
Georgia commited a paltry 54 penalties giving them a <i>z</i>-score 0f -2.43.

To try to see if the Delta YTS graphs are meaningful I need to rerun my code on a few seasons where we were more consistent on offence (e.g. 2020).
It's looking like if you can keep in the 0 to -5 yard band that you are neither in trouble nor are you in really good shape. 
If you get below -5 yards you either need an explosive play or a penalty to get you back on track.
If you are in the red zone then this analysis seems to break down.
