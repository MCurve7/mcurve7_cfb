I think looking at the Yards to success graph when supplimented with the Extra yards and Offensive drives graphs give a pretty good indication of how well a drive is going.
If a drive is hanging around 5 yards or lower on the Yards to success graph then the team seems to be doing well on that drive.
When the the drive starts to hang out above 5 yards and especially if it starts to increase monotonically that is a bad sign for that drive.
Looking at our Yards to success graph drives 1, 2, 3 they stay at 5 yards or higher for every play 
(ignore the last point on drive 3 that's after fourth down so I need to think about how to handle this situation)
and result in punts or a turnover on downs.
Drive 4 and 7 both remain at or below 5 yards and result in touchdowns.
Obviously this is not exact as drive 10 satys at or below 5 yards and we had to kick a field goal
and drive 9 bounces all over the place and we were still able to score a touchdown.
I think I might need to make a Yards to success/SR by Drive graph.
I want to rewatch the games with these graphs at hand and see if the play on the field correspond to what I think I'm seeing.

Bama then Ole below

<p>
Ole Miss's graphs seem to correlate to what I recall from the game.
Their offense seemed to be in control through most of the 1st half
and then we were able to disrupt their game plan for most of the second half.

As to penalties, unfortunately my code missed most of ours (but seems to have picked up on Ole Miss's penalties just fine).
I've been keeping a list of the penalties commited during the game so I was able to fill out the table of which penalties were called.
Also, the bye week is causing an problem with the line graph (last Bama/Ole Miss graph) but just mentally slide LSU over and it will be lined up correctly.
I need to add a table that records a Home/Away column along with the umber of penalties and annotate it in the line chart.
I'll also note that the tables below are generated from a different dataset and is correct.

<p>
The good news is that we were below our average with 5 penalties enforced and 1 penalty declined.
Of the 6 flags thrown on us,
4 are what I would consider effort penalties and the other 2 (Illegal Shift and Delay Of Game) mental errors.

Penalty team type status TABLE HERE

<p>
We are still tied for most penalized with Tennessee with 83 penalties total, 8.30 per game, and a z-score of 1.70 compared with other SEC schools.
We are at least no longer the worst in the country,
but our z-score with respect to the rest of the FBS is 2.32.
That's still pretty bad.
Navy is still the least penalized team with 34 total, 3.40 per game, and -3.06 as their z-score.
Georgia is still the least penalized SEC team and compared to the FBS: 44 total, 4.40 per game, and a -1.96 z-score.

That's all I have for this week. Roll Tide!
