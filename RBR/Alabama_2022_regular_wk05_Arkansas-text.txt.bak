I don't have much to say this week (stacks of tests to be graded and just nothing is popping out at me),
but I did add a variant of an already existing graph.
It's the Extra Yards Gained but faceted by Drive number.
I went back and generated them for Utah St, Texas, Louisiana Monroe, and Vanderbilt.
I don't know if there is anything to this (not much data, playing with the 2s, etc.), 
but when Milroe has a long drive* it seems to be more "unstable" than Bryce's long drives.

Bryce didn't have a long drive against Arkansas (drives 1-5),
but Milroe had one drive I would call a long, drive 7.

Versus Utah St all of Milroe's drives (9-11) were 5 plays or less.
Whereas Bryce had two long drives of 11 (drive 4) and 10 (drive 6).

<p>
Of course Texas was all Bryce all the time with long drives of 10 plays (drive 1), 9 (drive 3), 11 (drive 9)
and if 8 plays is a long drive (drives 10 and 11).
<b>Milroe drives 0</b>

Against Louisiana Monroe the only (true) long drive was also by Milroe which was drive 11 with 10 plays.

Finally we have Vanderbilt. Bryce's long drives were 10 plays (drive 3), 9 (drive 6), and 11 (drive 8).
Milroe had a drive of 15 plays (drive 11)!

Is there anything here or an I just seeing phantoms? 
This is why we develop statistics and decision procedures. 
I seem to be stuck on this idea of a statistical process contol idea of measuring a drive. 
Maybe a better way to look at it is as a stable or consistent drive.

* I'm not even sure how to define a long drive.  
I might find the drive length for all games and take the average and standard deviation. 
Maybe a long drive is any drive over 1 or maybe 2 standard deviations?

<p>
Arkansas's two longest drives (10 and 13) both ended with FGs. 
Drive 13 should have been 3 plays long but To'o To'o went temporarily dumb 
and extended it with a late hit. 
Then a pass interference penalty continued to help extend the drive to 12 plays.
