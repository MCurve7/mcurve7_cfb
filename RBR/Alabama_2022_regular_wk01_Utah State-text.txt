I rewrote all my code in a new language over the summer. 
I'm sure I have everything as accurate as the old code, but if you notice anything weird let me know. 
I spent a lot of time working on penalties, but the data source can be pretty bad.
Looking at the Vandy week 0 game there is 0 (zero) penalties for Vandy despite them committing around 5 penalties.
So I don't know how useful that work was, lol insert sad face emoji.

I was playing with Plotly to make interactive graphs, but have no clue how to inbed/link to them given the tools in FanPosts (or really anywhere, lol). 
I don't know if there is a to view them from GitHub, but here is the html I generated <a href="https://github.com/MCurve7/mcurve7_cfb/blob/main/RBR/Alabama_2022_regular_wk01_Utah%20State.html">https://github.com/MCurve7/mcurve7_cfb/blob/main/RBR/Alabama_2022_regular_wk01_Utah%20State.html</a>.
Maybe that will be helpful to someone.

Got the kung-flu over the weekend and about out of energy for this plus I've got to setup my home studio so I can teach online.
So I have nothing to add this week.
Feedback is always welcome, though it occurred to me that I didn't save the comments before CoralBeth wiped them out.
