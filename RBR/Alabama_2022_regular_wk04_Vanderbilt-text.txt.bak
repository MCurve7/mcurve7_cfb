A quite enjoyable game
and it seems like Jordan Rogers enjoys reliving the Mark Barron hit that stole his soul.
I had never heard him mention talking to the priest before.
I wonder if the announcers and crew puts in extra time to come up with topics of conversation before games like this
and how much of it they just wing.
Anyway on to the graphs.

I don't really have much to say about the graphs this week.
I've reordered the graphs so that the Extra yards gained, Offense drives (Yards gained), and Yards to success are adjacent. 
That feels like a more logical ordering.
This lead me to thinking about a 3D line graph with something like Play count along the x-axis, 
Yards gained along the y-axis,
and Yards to success along the z-axis.
But this is not really 3D data (in my brain).
So maybe Play count along the x-axis and either Yards gained along the y-axis and size of icon to represent Yards to success or visa versa.
If feels like there is something to be gained by combining these graphs...
in a way different than the Extra yards gained graph
or my exhaustion/possible brain fog is tricking me.
I can't verbalize what is tickling my brain.
OTOH it could be a false trail.

Looks like I'm going to have to think about how to handle week 0 penalties for the Penatlies line graph,
but that's for the future.
