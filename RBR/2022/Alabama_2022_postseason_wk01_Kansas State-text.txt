I suppose I will start with penalties since I've been concentrating on them all season.
For our final game we committed 5 penalties.
This is below our 7.92 average for the season 
and gave us a final <i>z</i>-score of 2.45 in comparison with all FBS teams.
We were penalized less than Tennessee (mean = 8.08, <i>z</i> = 2.64).
The summary stats for the whole FBS, SEC, Big 12, and Big Ten are shown below:

I'll briefly note that all four playoff teams had a negative <i>z</i>-score.
I don't know if that is normal,
but it doesn't seem surprising that a lack of discipline or what ever else that causes a large number of penalties would cause a team to miss the playoffs.

Something that I had intended to track this season was the SR vs 1st down/TD rate by down.
(A bug in translating my code left it off my Yards to be Successful vs Yards gained by Down graphs 
and I didn't remember that I generated a table with the same data, lol.)
SR seems to be a measure of how well you are keeping on track to gain a 1st down and hopefully a TD,
but the 1st/TD rate is, 
of course, 
the rate at which you make 1st downs and touchdowns.

I thought it was interesting that on 1st down our 1st/TD rate of 26% was close to KSt's SR of 30%
and on 2nd down our 1st/TD rate of 44% was higher than their SR of 30%.
Also for the game, our 1st/TD rate was 35% vs K St's 34% SR.
In the tables below we can see that the number of 1st and 2nd downs were similar.
I don't know how much can be made of these numbers yet,
but it feels appropriate given how well we played for most of the game.

<p>
Looking at the Delta yards to success (second graph above for Alabama and below for K St),
the trend of staying in the -5 yards and above band and moving the ball downfield seems to continue.
And if you get below -5 yards then an explosive play (or close to one) or penalty is needed to save the drive.

Well that's all I have for now.
I'm going to try to streamline and automate more of my process so that I can spend more time thinking about the data
and work on my writing.
It's certainly choppier than I would like and I don't always have the time to flesh out my thoughts.
As always any feedback is appreciated.

May all of our "disappointing" seasons be this "bad".
Roll Tide!
