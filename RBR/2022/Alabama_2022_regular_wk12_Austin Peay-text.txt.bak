I can't recall who said this but Tennessee is having their best season in 20 years 
and we are having one of our worst years since Saban arrived.
Both teams are 9-2, lol. 
I have some non-data related thoughts that I'll put after the graphs,
but this team is what they are.
The anouncers said correctly said that Bryce didn't throw the ball in practice for a month!
That's a whole lot of missed development time between the quarterback and the receivers.

Let's start with penalties. 
This is the second week with below average penalties including the one that was declined.
There were 4 enforced penalties and a holding call that was declined.
This is less than the current SEC avergae of 6.59.
While penalties are not directly calculated in the success rate they definitely affect it.
So I might have went a little overboard and calculated a summary for all of the FBS and each conference.
(I think in the future I will make a second post about penalties and any other non-success rate data that is not specific to Alabama or the SEC,
but for now it is near the bottom of the page.)
Tennessee is again the worst in the conference with a sum of 91, mean of 8.27, and <i>z</i>-score of 1.87.
We are second worse with a sum of 87, mean of 7.91, and <i>z</i>-score of 1.47.

I added a new graph that I am calling Delta yards to success (unless I think of a better name).
As suggested by krnxprs we define the Delta yards to success as the nominal yards to success and subtract the yards to success from it.
He defined the nominal yards to success as what would be your yards to success would be if you stayed pefectly on schedule.
So 
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr class = "header headerLastRow">
      <th style = "text-align: left;">Down</th>
      <th style = "text-align: left;">Yards</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">1st</td>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">5</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">2nd</td>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">3.5</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">1st</td>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">1.5</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">1st</td>
      <td style = "text-align: left;">0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

PS<br />
Obviously at this point this team is what they are. 
It seems like there are some that respond with yeah-yeah when it is brought up that the players have been battling anxiety.
I can't recall all of the responses,
but it seems that many think they should just get over it because reasons.
I think most of the people on this <i>not a messageboard</i> are somewhere in their 30s or older (I'd guess more likely in their 40s or older).
For many of us the pandemic was a major event that affected us and continues to affect us to some extent given its effect on society/culture,
but it is in many ways in the past and given our age and experience didn't greatly alter our personality (not sure that is the word I'm going for but can't think of a better one).
I have seem several places in the last few years that say that males don't reach full mental maturity until 25 years of age.
I don't know how much contact most of y'all have with 18-22 year olds (I teach math at a regional university),
but they are different than they were before the pandemic.
Some things have been coming for a while,
e.g. they have more difficulty in memorizing (I suspect because of such easy access to information on the internet)
and their visualization skills seem to be weaker which are two mental skills I'd think are of utmost importance to a football player.
But there are other more recent differences that I can't quite put my finger on,
but are affecting their ability to perform and I suspect are the result of the pandemic.

I don't know how many of you followed the 2-hour rule while in college,
but in case you have forgotten the rule says that for every hour you are in a class you should spend a <b>minimum</b> of two hours studying.
Since atheletes must be full time students that means they take at least 12 hours of class a week.
I may be a mathematician but I believe that makes a minimum of 12 + 2*12 = 36 hours a week just in classwork.
If the rule is still that they have a maximum of 20 hours a week for practice related activities
then they are up to 36 + 20 = 56 hours a week of academic and athletic activities.
I'm sure that doesn't include time with the trainers and that will be highly variable depending on the player.
That's a lot of hours and still doesn't include gameday and travel time.

Anyway,
I guess the point is that they are a bunch of young men who are under the a lot of pressure that few other people ever feel 
and especially at that age.
It's clear that overall the coaches haven't been able to get them into a position to be as successful as they should be,
but I trust Saban to rectify this after the season is over.
