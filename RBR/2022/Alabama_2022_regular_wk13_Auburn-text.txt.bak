In what is most likely to be the penultimate game of the 2022 season, 
the penalty penalty problems that seemed to be corrected showed back up.
There were 11 enforced penalties and one that was declined since it happened on the same as a DPI call.
(Unfortunately the play by play data doesn't record the declined penalties as reliably as I had hoped.)
Auburn decided to try to match us but were only able to commit 9 enforced penalties and 1 declined penalty.
This gives us 98 penalties for the regular season with a <i>z</i>-score of 1.84 
which edged out Tennessee (sum = 96, <i>z</i> = 1.64) for the most in the season.
Georgia commited a paltry 54 penalties giving them a <i>z</i>-score 0f -2.43.
