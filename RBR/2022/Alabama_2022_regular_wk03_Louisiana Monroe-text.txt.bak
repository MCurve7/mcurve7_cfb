Quick note about the data, there are rows with duplicate information but the rows are not actual duplicates. 
E.g. in drive 4 it looks like there are two consecutive incomplete passes, 
but it's just duplicated information in the dataset.
Same for drive 5,
we did not punt one two consecutive plays obviously.
So I'll have to think how to automate their removal if I can.

I don't have a lot of thoughts about this game from looking at teh data/statistics.
(Partly since I'm still recovering from the kung-flu I got a couple of weeks ago.)
The one thing that has burrowed into my brain is the SPC-inspired view of the Extra Yards Gained graph 
and the idea of a sustained drive.
I'm going to try to flesh out my thoughts on it,
but it might take till after the season is over before I can really dig in.

Looking at our Extra Yards Gained graph,
our 1st, 3rd, 6th, (maybe) 8th, and 9th drives look to be sustaine drives.
I'm not sure what to think about drive 11. 
It started out well and other than a penalty on play 51 and incomplete pass on play 53 we were successful.
Plays 55-57 were unsuccessful and then we scored a rushing TD on play 58.
Drive 12 was the kneel down drive so the end of that data is misleading.

Looking at ULM's Extra Yards Gained graph looks pretty satisfying.
They had one drive that could be said to be sustained, drive 6.
Drive 7 started out really well for them,
but petered out at the end.

In terms of penalties,
I need to look at the game tape and see if that was a declined penalty on play number 57.
I thought there was one,
but I can't find it or maybe I'm confusing myself with the flag that was picked up.
It was disappinting that we had a penalty on the first play of the game.

We are unsurprisingly the most penalized SEC team so far this season for SEC vs FBS (see graphs at the bottom of the page),
but Missouri is not far behind us.
There have been so few SEC vs SEC games that I don't know how much can be gleaned from those penalty charts yet.
