Not much to say about this game. 
Jalen Milroe is not ready to be the starter at quarterback based solely  on protecting the ball.
Hopefully he'll learn from this and correct it if we need him again this season.
The data isn't recording his sack-fumbles where I expected it to,
so I'll have to add some code to catch this. 
I'm also missing 3 penalties and will have to dig into the data to see what happened there.
Looking at the SR by Drive graph we broke 50% twice: drive 6 and drive 12.
Drive 6 was only 3 plays long with two very explosive plays:
Gibbs ran for 37 yards and then a pass to Burton for 35 yards.
I'll discuss drive 12 below.

I guess looking at the Extra yards gained and Offense drives by drive graphs are the best graphs I have available to discuss what happened in this game. 
I'll concentrate  on drives 4, 11, 12, and 13.
Drive 4 started out unsuccessful on the first 2 plays but gained enough yards that the A&amp;M penalty got us a 1st down.
We continued to make non-negative yardage on every play with an almost explosive (14 yards) and an explosive (33 yards) play to move us down the field
which culminated with a TD pass to Latu.
There were no incomplete passes nor any sacks on this drive according to the data.
The SR was a horrible 37.5% aka 3/8, 
but it ended in a score.

Drive 11 had a 50% SR and was looking like a nice drive until an A&amp;M defender did an excellent job of putting his hat on the ball and caused McClellan to fumble.
Our worst (non-fumble) play was a pass that was a reception for a 5 yard loss that A&amp;M immediately returned to us by way of a penalty.
This looked to be a very nice drive that was marred by that fumble and we can't blame Milroe for that.
Again we didn't have an incomplete pass nor a sack on this drive.
</p>

<p>
The best looking drive in the graphs was drive 12 until <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Spoiler Alert</FONT> the last 2 plays.
Other than those 2 plays, every play had positive yardage and the drive had a SR of 60% 
and was the second highest behind drive 6 mentioned above.
We started with a rushing gain of 13 and then 11 yards and then 7 yards but unfortunately the negative trend in yardage basically continued until disaster.
There was one successful pass of 7 yards but on the penultimate play Milroe took a sack for a 12 yard loss.
Then Reichard missed a 47 yard field goal.
They say kicking has a huge mental component and who knows why he had a bad night.
I'm just glad my mistakes aren't broadcast to millions of viewers and that I can catch and correct them a few days later.

The last drive of interest was drive 13.
It consisted of 10 plays thanks to A&amp;M honoring their 12th man tradition and having 12 men on the field during our punt on play number 4 and giving a 1st down.
We did have one explosive pass for 15 yards and then A&amp;M again helped us with a roughing the passer to add 14 more yards to that play.
Note to self: add code to collect penalty yards.
The SR was 33.3% and it felt like it.
We had 2 incomplete passes and 3 non-positive plays.
And Reichard missed a second field goal in a row.
Let's hope he shakes them off and is back to his normal self soon.

One other interesting thing I noticed is in the Yards to be Successful vs Yards gained by Down non-scaled/scaled graphs.
On first down we were sitting right on top of the 10 yards distance to a 1st/TD line.
The only other game that looked like this was vs Texas where every play other than 1 also sat on the 10 yards to a 1st/TD line.
Meaningful?
I don't know other than we didn't to get within 10 yards of the goalline for a 1st down.
The only other possible cause of this that I can think of is defensive penalties on 1st down giving us a shortened to go yardage,
but none of the other graphs show a 5 yards to go data point.
So at least for this year it would seem to be not getting within 10 yards a touchdown on 1st down.

As for the penalties for all SEC teams for the season so far,
we have the highest average against all other FBS teams and recall that as of the time of the writing of this I haven't added the 3 penalties that the data missed.
But looking only at SEC vs SEC penalties LSU and Tennessee have worse averages.
LSU is at 8.67 enforced penalties as compared to a SEC average of 5.83.
Even better for us Tennessee is sitting at 9.
I added the Tennessee line graph at the end of this post, 
but haven't checked the numbers to ensure correctness (though if incorrect then the numbers will go up and not down).
