A quite enjoyable game
and it seems like Jordan Rogers enjoys reliving the Mark Barron hit that stole his soul.
I had never heard him mention talking to the priest before.
I wonder if the announcers and crew puts in extra time to come up with topics of conversation before games like this
and how much of it they just wing.
I really enjoy having Cublic on the sidelines.
Dude knows his line play and does a great job explaining it.
I wish more announcers would spend more time explaining the game and less whatever the usually do.
Anyway on to the graphs.

I don't really have much to say about the graphs this week.
Basically they look like what they should when one team dominates another.
Looking at the Sucess rate by drive Bama graph there were two drives (7 and 8) with a above 0.5 SR that didn't end in a touchdown.
Drive 7 started just 33 seconds before the half and 80 yards to go.
We were able to get it down to 22 yards to go and could have scored a TD and had to take the FG instead.

<p>
Drive 8 started with 88 yards to go and after a penalty near then end of the drive that set us back to 17 yards to go we had to settle for a FG.
We were still able to get it down to 4 yards to go and had two chances to punch it in so who knows what would have happened if we hadn't had that penalty.

I've reordered the graphs so that the Extra yards gained, Offense drives (Yards gained), and Yards to success are adjacent. 
That feels like a more logical ordering.
This lead me to thinking about a 3D line graph with something like Play count along the x-axis, 
Yards gained along the y-axis,
and Yards to success along the z-axis.
But this is not really 3D data (in my brain).
So maybe Play count along the x-axis and either Yards gained along the y-axis and size of icon to represent Yards to success or visa versa.
If feels like there is something to be gained by combining these graphs...
in a way different than the Extra yards gained graph
or my exhaustion/possible brain fog is tricking me.
I can't verbalize what is tickling my brain.
OTOH it could be a false trail.

Looks like I'm going to have to think about how to handle week 0 penalties for the Penatlies line graph,
but that's for the future.

In case this is helpful,
I think you should be able to download the html located at 
https://github.com/MCurve7/mcurve7_cfb/blob/main/RBR/Alabama_2022_regular_wk04_Vanderbilt.html
and open it in your browser to view the graphs in an interactive way.

Roll Tide!
