<p>
Almost caught up at work, but still didn't have time to really analyize my graphs.
I did spend a little bit of time automating the table below.
It uses the "official" penalty data since the play text doesn't reliably contain the penalty data
and that is where I'm getting my penalties data from for the graphs and tables.
So you will notice some discrepancies  in my data/graphs and the table below.
Since we are dealing with a small sample size we should expect some  decently sized fluctuations in the <i>z</i>-scores from week to week.
Our low number of penalties and Tennessee's close to average (for them) number of penalties drew our <i>z</i>-scores closer together.

An interesting pattern in this data is that every SEC west team has a positive <i>z</i>-score,
even if just barely,
and other than Tennessee and Missouri every SEC east team has a negative <i>z</i>-score.
I don't know if this trend will continue
and if it does, what does it mean... if anything.

<p>
I know that pretty much everyone is unhappy with our offensive production
and that the defense preformed as pretty much everyone expected,
but I was pleased with the limited number of penalties.
Of the three, two were PIs on their last drive.

<p>
I have an idea about classifing penalties as to whesther they were judgement calls and whether they were effort penalties.
I might make a post next weekend explaining what I mean and how I have them classified so far.
If anyone thinks it's worth persuing I'll spend time fleshing it out (maybe after the season is over).
