Rephrasing the idea in just words--which I know I've done, but I think I get better at it the more times I do it--it compares the number of risky yards required (yards to go on 3rd down) to the number of safe yards gained (1st down, 2nd down, and yards on 3rd/4th down past the first down marker). The fewer yards you have to go on 3rd down, the less likely you'll have to punt or attempt a FG. The more yards you gain safely, the less likely you'll have to punt or attempt a FG. It's not trying to measure performance on 3rd/4th down. It measures your ability to not have to perform on 3rd/4th down, which helps answer the key question of the BoB era: are we relying too much on 3rd down success?

The basic idea is to form a ratio of the total yards to go on 3rd down (the perilous yards to go) to the yards gained outside of peril (non-peril yards gained). Non-peril yards gained include the following.
*All yards gained on 1st down
*All yards gained on 2nd down
*Total of yards gained in excess of yards to go on 3rd down, if any. If you don't exceed the yards to go on a given 3rd down play, you don't add the yards gained on the play to this total.
*Total of yards gained in excess of yards to go on 4th down, if any. If you don't exceed the yards to go on a given 4th down play, you don't add the yards gained on the play to this total.

This ratio is the "peril yards ratio." The smaller the value the better. But what is a good value? To determine a good baseline, we can look to the formula for success rate and the concept of "nominal efficiency."

Um...I'm not sure entirely how the penalty yardage is ultimately accounted for in all those values I'm calculating. I'm parsing the 3rd and 4th down plays manually on ESPN's play-by-play page. For each 3rd down, I record the to-go yardage and the yards gained in a table. If there's a penalty on that play, here's what I do.

If there was a defensive penalty, I record the original to-go yards. The yards gained depends...
*If it was enough for the first down, I put 0 for the yards gained.
*If it only shortened the distance, I record the yards gained for the next play-by-play line.

If there was an offensive penalty on the play, I ignore the play-by-play line and use the next one for to-go yards and yards gained.

If they go for it on 4th, I'm only recording the to-go yards from 3rd down and adding the yards gained on 3rd and 4th downs together.

That's the only data I'm pulling out besides the total offensive yards. I tally up the 3rd yards gained (which includes 4th yards gained) and subtract that from total yards to get 1st-2nd yards gained. In my 3rd down table, I make a column that takes the min of to-go and yards gained for that line. I total that column to get 3rd & 4th yds non-excess. Everything is derived from these pieces of data.

I noticed your 1st-2nd yards gained and 3rd-4th yards gained aren't adding up to the total yards. And one other thing that could be a significant difference is that, right or wrong, I did not treat our punt snap snafu as a 4th down attempt. I may should have taken that yardage out of the offensive total since I was treating it as a non-offensive play. That would have made the total yardage go up and lowered (improved) our peril yards ratio.

The way I get my 3rd down data is I go to the espn's play-by-play page for the game and expand all the Alabama drives.
https://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay/_/gameId/401403902
Then I use ctrl-F to find "3rd &" and read each one. There are 17 on the page, but two of the 3rd downs had penalties. Maybe this is the source of our difference for 3rd downs/snaps?

3rd & 3 at ARK 7
(2:57 - 2nd) ALABAMA Penalty, Offensive Pass Interference (-15 Yards) to the Ark 22

3rd & 18 at ARK 22
(2:51 - 2nd) Jalen Milroe pass complete to JoJo Earle for 22 yds for a TD, (Will Reichard KICK)


3rd & 10 at ALA 25
(14:51 - 4th) ALABAMA Penalty, False Start (-5 Yards) to the Alab 20

3rd & 15 at ALA 20
(14:30 - 4th) Jalen Milroe run for 77 yds to the Ark 3 for a 1ST down

Those only count as 2 3rd down situations. For the first situation I use 18 yds to go, 22 yds gained, 18 non-excess.

For the second situation I use 15 yds to go, 77 yds gained, 15 non-excess.

Hmm, my data is also showing another penalty Q2, 5:02, 3rd & 3 Yards_to_goal=34
ARKANSAS Penalty, Defensive Holding (10 Yards) to the Ark 24 for a 1ST down

3rd & 3 at ARK 34
(5:02 - 2nd) ARKANSAS Penalty, Defensive Holding (10 Yards) to the Ark 24 for a 1ST down

Yeah, for that play I use 3 yds to go, 0 yds gained, 0 non-excess.
